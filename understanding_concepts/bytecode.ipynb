    "Python's bytecode is an intermediate language used by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) to execute Python code efficiently. Here are some key points about Python's bytecode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of your source code. It is not binary machine code and cannot be run directly by the target machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bytecode is generated from Python source code through a process called compilation. In Python, the default implementation is [CPython]('https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations?action=show&redirect=implementation), which compiles Python source code into bytecode\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bytecode files have a .pyc extension and are stored in a folder named __pycache__. In Python 3, the bytecode files are stored in a folder named __pycache__ so it can eliminate the compilation stage after the first one. 👍\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bytecode interpreter is part of the Python ecosystem and is responsible for executing the bytecode. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The CPython interpreter is an open-source implementation of the Python interpreter, and its implementation of the bytecode interpreter can be found on [GitHub]('https://github.com/python/cpython')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding Python bytecode can help you reason about your code and optimize its performance. It can also be useful for debugging and analyzing the execution of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dis module in Python provides a disassembler for Python bytecode, which can be used to inspect and analyze the bytecode instructions.\n"
